D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture arising from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>

For instance, host plant resistance is successfully used in some crops with pest and illness tolerant or resistant ranges, but not in other crops.</p>
