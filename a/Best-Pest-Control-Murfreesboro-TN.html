<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about 10 years, mainly among scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are frequently monocultures, including a single crop types, which produces a homogenous habitat frequently lacking essential requirements of natural opponents, thus preferring pest species.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a reliable and ecologically sensitive  method to pest management that depends on a mix of sensible practices. IPM is an approach to guarantee economic viability at both customer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly expected to earn a profit), ecological safety through a well balanced usage of all offered pest control alternatives, and social acceptability since IPM-based food is inexpensive and safe.</p>

When searching for a location to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that supplies food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>Considering that IPM programme applies the most cost-effective management pest methods, success is made sure for the grower or farmer.
