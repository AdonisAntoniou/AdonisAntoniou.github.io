<p>For some jobs, pest control workers use a mix of pest management strategies, a practice called integrated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though challenged by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the increase of pest control.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches along with its variety of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.
