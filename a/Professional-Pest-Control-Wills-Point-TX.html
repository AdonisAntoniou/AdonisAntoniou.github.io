Preventive practices are essential part of an IPM programme. Through making use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, our state-certified specialists provide treatment and prevention services for your house year-round.</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be used in the way least disruptive to biological control.
