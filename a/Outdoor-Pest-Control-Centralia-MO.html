<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been effectively utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Stay vigilant and call your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop varieties typically inadvertently develop conditions which favor pest types (e.g., pest species which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural opponents). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an intrusive types introduced to a brand-new location when resources are plentiful (that is, individuals without resistance) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered products to use in management (such as federally approved medications).</p>
