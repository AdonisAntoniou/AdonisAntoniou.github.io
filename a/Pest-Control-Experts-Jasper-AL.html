CHEMICAL CONTROL OF BUG PEST: Usage of synthetic chemicals for handling pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals utilized for this are called insecticides.</p>
<p>Biological pest control measures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents assists to prevent unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control service technicians even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to accept collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance. </p>
