All nations acknowledged IPM as a desirable method to pest control even if it was not commonly adopted. Pests are a major hazard that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally happening microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi ), likewise fall in this classification.</p>
