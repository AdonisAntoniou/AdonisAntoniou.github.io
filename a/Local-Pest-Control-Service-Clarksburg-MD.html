The four significant issues experienced with conventional pesticides are poisonous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest renewal. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a method that avoids pest damage with minimum adverse impact on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, stick around in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be a crucial part of an integrated pest management programme.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is triggered thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
