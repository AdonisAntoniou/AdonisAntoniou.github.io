	<meta name="description" content="Exterminator Pest Control in Richmond VA - The degree of damage depends on the growing season and environmental conditions ( Khaliq et al., 2014 ). One pest species, Yellow Stem Borer (YSB-Scirpophaga incertulas; Lepidoptera Crambidae), is considered to be a major rice pest ( Chatterjee and Mondal, 2014 ). Rice plants damaged by this insect develop unhealthy tillers and hills, Dead Heart (central leaf drying), and White Head (grain-less panicles), all of which affect the overall yield ( Satpathi et al., 2012 ). According to DAE (2011) YSB populations can be reduced through several IPM methods, including: light trapping (placing a light source inside a funnel-shaped trap), hand picking eggs from rice leaves (Leaves with egg masses are removed from plants by hand during tillering and booting stages), sweeping (using a funnel shaped net to capture insects), perching (installing a branch or pole which serves as a resting place for predatory birds), cultivation of insect resistant rice varieties, using bio-agents releasing predator insects such as Long horned grasshopper Conocephalus longipennis (Haan), applying Economic Threshold Level (ETL) based insecticides (The ETL is the point at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest).">

For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although practical in minimizing environmental contamination and security issues, still does not truly attend to the ecologically based weak point of the conventional pest control technique.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply selected biopesticides with low ecological impact. Expert exterminators use different kinds of pesticides and baits to eliminate and remove pests. Reliable, permanent corrective actions can then be taken to avoid pests from going into the structure and infesting the building and collections. </p>
<p>And given that pests act in a different way even within a types, managing them successfully needs special knowledge of the pests themselves, as well as methods to securely and efficientlymanage them. Essential documents include a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, corrective action reports, trap layout maps, lists of approved pesticides, pesticide use reports and applicator licenses.</p>
