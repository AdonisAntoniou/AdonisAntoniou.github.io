<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and discourage pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
