When mobile data-capture devices were introduced, pest control professionals were able to catch real-time data about the area and nature of pest problems and after that keep it in a main database online that both facility supervisors and pest control specialists might access.</p>
<p>There are numerous pest control companies located all over the city, that is why, is necessary to know which one is the best in order to avoid being cheated by any mediocre company. Home pests can consist of insects such as cockroaches, mosquitoes and flies, or rodents like mice or rats.

<p>The different contributors involved in the value chain of the insect pest control market consist of basic material providers, R&D institutes, insect pest control services making companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and government bodies & regulatory associations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).</p>
