<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
