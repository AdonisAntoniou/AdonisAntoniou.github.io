<p>The merging of the ideas of incorporated control and pest management, and the ultimate synthesis into integrated pest management, opened a new period in the protection of agricultural crops, domestic animals, stored items, public health, and the structure of human homes versus the attack of arthropod pests, plant and animal diseases, and weeds.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were decreased from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and got rid of completely by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - indicates a common method of ruining pests as it takes place in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps avoid the requirement to deal with substantial populations that may trigger crop damage.
