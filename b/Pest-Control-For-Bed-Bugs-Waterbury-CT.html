Chemical controls were to be used just after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the expense of the control measures.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is likewise based on semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are repelled or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are at the same time brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ).
