<h3>Wasp Elimination Macon Georgia</h2>
<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable method that incorporates practices for the economic prevention and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Special safety measures need to be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic approach to pest control.</p>
<p>The determination of the appropriate reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect species or life stages.</p>

We should turn more to developing farming practices that are compatible with ecological systems and developing cropping systems that naturally restrict the elevation of an organism to pest status.</p>
