<p>Biological pest control measures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed. Understanding of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control specialists even repair structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses a lot of the same principles as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
