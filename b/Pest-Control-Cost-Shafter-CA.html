<p>Therefore IPM is best combination of all possible methods in pest management with least reliance on chemical pesticide. Management choices need to be based on tracking and population levels of insect pests, as well as dependable thresholds. IPM addresses all the financial, environmental, and social elements and provides safe and inexpensive food to the profits and consumers to producers and sellers, while maintaining environmental health.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that suitable control decisions can be made in combination with action thresholds.
