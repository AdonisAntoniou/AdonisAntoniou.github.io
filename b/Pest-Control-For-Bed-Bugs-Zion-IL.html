<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of large, costly houses, so pest control costs might be greater there due to the fact that there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
