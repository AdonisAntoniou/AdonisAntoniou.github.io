The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are frequently found pests in our society.</p>

<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all tactics. This chapter talks about various methods to keep pest insects at bearable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep family pets and children far from areas where pesticides have actually been used.</p>
