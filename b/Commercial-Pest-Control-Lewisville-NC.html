<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a ecologically delicate and efficient technique to pest management that depends on a mix of common-sense practices.

<p>The course will concentrate on the ecological and management concepts of pest control and you will learn to examine the repercussions of pesticide usage and application on the biological target.

<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been efficiently used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in organic farming may control some pests, but can negatively impact natural opponents and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might encourage natural opponent populations, however a greater variety of natural enemies does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling make use of fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
