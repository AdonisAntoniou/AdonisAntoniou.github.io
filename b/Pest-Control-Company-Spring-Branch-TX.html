<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
