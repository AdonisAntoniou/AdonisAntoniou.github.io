<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a mix of pest management techniques, a practice called integrated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, weeds, and arthropods, though challenged by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest benefits of natural techniques is that they don't include using toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; keep in mind, do not eliminate the useful insects. However the exterminators not just help you in removing the pests from your home, but they make sure the pests will not return. IPM stresses using non-chemical control methods, such as exemption or trapping, prior to chemical alternatives.</p>

Instead, the pest control service technician ought to focus on the food handling and vending areas, using bait applications rather than spraying. They incorporate cultural, biological, mechanical, chemical and physical practices to manage pests. Using physical traps to control pests is perhaps the most recognisable pest control measures. </p>
