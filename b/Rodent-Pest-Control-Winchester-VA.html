<p>Because crop production is extremely precise due to modern innovations on one hand, as well as extremely variable depending upon a myriad of abiotic and biotic aspects and the exclusive practices of different farming operations, info management and decision-making parts play a vital role in IPM. Utilizing IPM to prevent pest issues and reduce reliance on pesticides is the very best solution for a healthy environment for everybody.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been successfully utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
