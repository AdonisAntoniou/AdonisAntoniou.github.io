<p>Think about alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a building. Current missions for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have actually been targeted mainly toward development of new and better items with which to replace conventional hazardous pesticides.</p>
